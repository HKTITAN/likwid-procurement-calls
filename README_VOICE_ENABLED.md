# üé§ Voice-Enabled Procurement Automation System

## Revolutionary Voice Quote Collection

This system has been enhanced with **real-time voice quote collection** that automatically captures vendor pricing during phone calls using speech recognition technology.

## üöÄ How It Works

### The Voice-Enabled Workflow

1. **üìû Interactive Calls**: System calls vendors and asks them to speak their quotes
2. **üé§ Voice Recording**: Records vendor responses using Twilio TwiML
3. **üß† Speech Recognition**: Converts speech to text using advanced AI
4. **üí∞ Price Parsing**: Intelligently extracts pricing from spoken responses
5. **üìä Real-time Updates**: Updates CSV files with actual vendor quotes
6. **üèÜ Smart Comparison**: Compares all voice quotes and selects cheapest

### Sample Call Flow

**System**: *"Namaste, this is Bio Mac Lifesciences calling for price quotes. We need quotes for 200 units of USB-C Cables, 100 units of Wireless Mouse. Please provide your best pricing for each item. After I finish speaking, please state your prices clearly."*

**Vendor**: *"USB cables will be 12 rupees per unit, wireless mouse 28 rupees each"*

**System**: ‚úÖ *Automatically parses: USB-C Cables = ‚Çπ12/unit, Wireless Mouse = ‚Çπ28/unit*

## üéØ Key Features

### Real-Time Quote Collection
- **Live Speech Processing**: Captures vendor quotes as they speak
- **Intelligent Parsing**: Understands various ways vendors state prices
- **Automatic CSV Updates**: Updates pricing data in real-time
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Uses estimated pricing if speech fails

### Advanced Voice Recognition
- **Multiple Price Formats**: Handles "12 rupees", "‚Çπ12", "12 per unit", etc.
- **Item Matching**: Maps spoken item names to inventory IDs
- **Context Awareness**: Understands pricing context and quantities
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of unclear audio

### Smart Quote Comparison
- **Real-time Analysis**: Compares actual spoken quotes
- **Cost Optimization**: Always selects the cheapest total cost
- **Transparent Process**: Shows all quotes received
- **Audit Trail**: Complete record of voice quotes and decisions

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Voice Processing Stack
```
Twilio Call ‚Üí TwiML Recording ‚Üí Speech-to-Text ‚Üí Price Parsing ‚Üí CSV Update
```

### Dependencies
- **SpeechRecognition**: For voice processing
- **pydub**: For audio manipulation  
- **Twilio**: For phone calls and recording
- **requests**: For API communication

### Quote Parsing Patterns
The system recognizes multiple pricing formats:
- `"USB cables 12 rupees per unit"`
- `"Wireless mouse costs 25 rupees"`
- `"HDMI adapters at 18 rupees each"`
- `"12.50 for cables, 25.75 for mouse"`

## üìû Usage Examples

### Basic Voice-Enabled Procurement
```powershell
# Run complete voice workflow
python caller.py voice

# Run with interactive menu
python caller.py interactive

# Test voice quote collection
python caller.py test-voice
```

### Demo and Testing
```powershell
# Voice system demo
python demo_voice_procurement.py

# Test voice parsing
python test_voice_parsing.py

# Quick workflow test
python caller.py two-phase
```

## üé§ Voice System Status

When you run the system, check these indicators:

‚úÖ **Speech Recognition: Ready** - Voice quotes will be processed  
‚úÖ **Audio Processing: Ready** - Audio files will be handled  
üìû **Callable vendors: X** - Number of vendors available for calls
