# Two-Phase Procurement Automation System

## Overview

This system implements an advanced two-phase procurement workflow that ensures competitive pricing through automated vendor quote collection and comparison.

## üîÑ Two-Phase Workflow

### Phase 1: Quote Collection
1. **Inventory Analysis**: Check current stock levels against minimum thresholds
2. **Vendor Identification**: Find all vendors who can supply required items
3. **Quote Requests**: Call each vendor to request pricing quotes
4. **Real-time Updates**: Update CSV files with current market pricing
5. **Quote Logging**: Track all quote requests and responses

### Phase 2: Price Comparison & Ordering
6. **Quote Analysis**: Compare all received quotes side-by-side
7. **Vendor Selection**: Automatically select vendor with lowest total cost
8. **Order Placement**: Call winning vendor to confirm order
9. **Documentation**: Send email confirmation and generate reports
10. **Audit Trail**: Maintain complete procurement history

- Minimum thresholds
- Reorder quantities
- Preferred vendors

### 2. `data/vendors.csv`
- Vendor contact information
- Ratings and delivery times
- Payment terms
- Call permissions

### 3. `data/vendor_items_mapping.csv`
- Item-specific pricing
- Bulk discounts
- Availability status
- **Updated in real-time with quotes**

## üìû Call Workflow

### Quote Request Calls
```
"Namaste, this is an automated quote request call from [Company Name]. 
We need quotes for the following items: [Item List]. 
Please provide your best pricing for these items. 
We will place orders based on competitive pricing and service quality."
```

### Final Order Calls

After evaluating all quotes received, we are pleased to confirm 
your selection as our vendor for [Items]. 
You offered the most competitive pricing among all vendors.

- Error tracking
- Decision audit trail

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Example 1: Check System Status
```python
from caller import show_csv_inventory_status, show_csv_vendor_info

# Check which items need reordering
show_csv_inventory_status()

# View available vendors
show_csv_vendor_info()
```

### Example 2: Run Quote Collection Only
```python
from caller import run_two_phase_procurement_workflow

# This will:
# 1. Identify items needing procurement
# 2. Call vendors for quotes
# 3. Update CSV with current pricing
# 4. Compare quotes and select winner
# 5. Place final order
run_two_phase_procurement_workflow()
```

### Example 3: Test Connectivity
```python
from caller import test_simple_twilio_call

# Test Twilio phone system
test_simple_twilio_call()
```
