## üìû How Vendor Calls Work Now

### Previous System
```
System: "We need quotes for items. We'll email you for pricing."
(Manual follow-up required)
```

### New Voice-Enabled System
```
System: "We need quotes for 200 USB cables, 100 wireless mice. 
         Please speak your prices clearly after this message."

Vendor: "USB cables will be 12 rupees per unit, 
         wireless mouse 28 rupees each"

System: ‚úÖ Automatically captures:
        - USB cables: ‚Çπ12/unit 
        - Wireless mouse: ‚Çπ28/unit
        - Updates CSV instantly
        - Continues to next vendor
```

## üéØ Key Capabilities

### Voice Recognition Patterns
The system understands various ways vendors quote prices:
- `"USB cables 12 rupees per unit"`
- `"Wireless mouse costs 25 rupees"`  
- `"HDMI adapters at 18 rupees each"`
- `"12.50 for cables, 25.75 for mouse"`
- `"The price will be 15 rupees"`

### Smart Quote Processing
- **Item Matching**: Maps spoken names to inventory items
- **Price Extraction**: Finds prices in various formats
- **Context Understanding**: Handles quantities and units
- **Error Recovery**: Uses fallback pricing when needed
